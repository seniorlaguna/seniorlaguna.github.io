    <h1>Calculator - Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Below we provide information about the processing of data when using the app "Calculator".</p>

    <h2>1. Responsible authority</h2>
    <p>Responsible in regard for the processing data:
    <ul>
        <li>Florian Teich</li>
        <li>Paul-Dessau Stra√üe 1</li>

    <h2>2. Scope of data processing</h2>
    <p>We process personal data provided by the user within the scope of this contract for a specific
        purpose and in accordance with the statutory provisions. For using the app, we store the following
        data of the user:
    <ul>
        <li>data provided via the app store (e-mail address, username)</li>
        <li>technical information (device ID, operating system version, browser)</li>
        <li>as well as further data if these are provided voluntarily by the users in the context of the use
            of the app</li>

    </ul>
    This processing is carried out to fulfil the contract of use according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR. <br />
    The data will be stored until the user deletes his account or asserts his data protection right to
    delete.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Analysis</h2>
    <p>We use an analysis tool from Google with which we can evaluate the use of functions of the app. This
        does not include personal data that would allow us to draw conclusions about your processes.
        Rather, with Google Analytics we can only determine which modules, settings, etc. are used by the
        users. The legal basis for data processing is therefore Art. 6. para. 1 lit. f DSGVO (legitimate interest).
        Google Analytics is a service of Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4,
        Ireland.</p>

    <h2>4. Data transfer</h2>
    <p>Personal data will be treated as strictly confidential and will not be disclosed to third parties unless
        expressly consented to by the users. An exception applies if this is necessary in the context of the
        performance of the contract or if there is a legitimate interest.</p>
